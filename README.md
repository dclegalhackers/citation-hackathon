# Legal Citation Hackathon

## What will be "hacked" on?

- Improving citation parsers (such as github.com/unitedstates/citation)
- Building applications that use the parsers (such as github.com/adelevie/downlaw)
- Anything else! If you're generally interested in legal hacking, but not in legal citations, please attend! We're happy to facilitate collaboration between lawyers and coders.

## Schedule: 

9:30 - 10 Breakfast

10 - 12 Hacking

12 - 12:30 Lunch

12:30 - 4:00 Continued Hacking 

After: drinks, pats on backs, better citation technology
